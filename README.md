Makes GitHub display things at your browser's width.

Written because I use a tiling window manager with my browser often taking up
1/2 of my screen width, and the new wide layout min-width causes annoying
horizontal scrolling.

This could be much more refined (to handle reflow of the UI elements in the top
bars better), but it's good enough to solve my problem and make GitHub a more
usable experience for me.

### Things that still annoy me:

- The table of files/commits at the top of repo tree browsing pages grows the page.
- The search bar at the top grows the page.
- The name of repos in `mini-repo-list-item`s overflow and can overlap and/or grow the page.
- Some buttons overflow out of their containers.
- The whole button reflow madness.
- Other things I don't remember right now.

Pull requests happily accepted! :)
