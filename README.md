Makes GitHub display things at your browser's width.

Written because I use a tiling window manager with my browser often taking up
1/2 of my screen width, and the new wide layout min-width causes annoying
horizontal scrolling.

This could be much more refined (to handle reflow of the UI elements in the top
bars better), but it's good enough to solve my problem and make GitHub a more
usable experience for me.
